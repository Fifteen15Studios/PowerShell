# Task Sequence Scripts

Scripts in this folder are designed to be run as part of an SCCM Task Sequence. Most of them are designed to be run as part of an Operating System Deployment (OSD) Task Sequence.

Because they are designed to run inside of a task sequence, they may refer to task sequence variables or reference values or functionality that is only available as part of a task sequence.
