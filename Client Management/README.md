# Client Management

These scripts are written to be run on a client computer to do various tasks. Most of them are even more useful if used with inside of `Invoke-Command` to run it on a remote computer.

There are more client management scripts inside of the [SCCM folder](https://github.com/Fifteen15Studios/PowerShell/tree/master/SCCM). Those scripts are designed to be run inside of SCCM, but most can be used ourside of SCCM as well. Some may need some minor modifications to be made before they can be used as a stand-alone script.
